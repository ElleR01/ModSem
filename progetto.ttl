(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Baby, your dada loves you
And I'ma always be here for you
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
No matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
I would never give you up for nothin'
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

[Verse 1]
C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin' to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let Dada strap you in the car seat
Oh, where's Mama? She's takin' a little nap in the trunk
Oh, that smell? Dada must've runned over a skunk
Now, I know what you're thinkin', it's kind of late to go swimmin'
But you know your Mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with Dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it (No)
And don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful?
Don't you wanna help Dada build a sandcastle? (Yeah)
And Mama said she wants to show you how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch, it don't hurt
Her was eatin' dinner while you were sweepin'
And spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy, ain't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can play by ourselves, can't we?

Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I (See, honey)

[Verse 2]
There's a place called Heaven and a place called Hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And Dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one
'Cause Mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother, do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough
To understand a little better, I'll explain it to ya
But for now, we'll just say Mama was real, real bad
Was bein' mean to Dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time out
Sit back in your chair, honey, quit tryna climb out
I told you it's okay, Hai-Hai, want a ba-ba?
Take a night-night? Na-na-boo, goo-goo-ga-ga?
Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Dada change your didee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter
[Chorus]
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I

[Verse 3]
Wake up, sweepyhead, we're here, before we pway
We're gonna take Mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry, honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you scweamin' in her ear (Mama)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Dada made a nice bed for Mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help Dada tie a rope around this rock? (Yeah)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free
One, two, free, whee
There goes Mama, spashin' in the water
No more fightin' with Dad, no more restraining order
No more step-dada, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell Mama you love her (Mommy)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help Dad with two more things out the trunk
[Chorus]
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I

[Outro]
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Just me and you, baby, is all we need in this world
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Just me and you
Your dada will always be here for you
Your dada's always gonna love you, remember that
If you ever need me, I'ma always be here for you
You ever need anything, just ask
Dada will be right there
Your dada loves you
I love you, baby"""@it ;

Woke up with an attitude today
Not in the mood to play (Nah)
Might start a feud with Dre (Yeah)
And ask him to shoot the fade (That's what I do)
All I do is spray, spew the hate while I fuel the flames
Who to blame for my screwed-up brain?
You could say, in the booth, I'm A-human A-to-the-K (Aw)
(Hailie, look) Look at them two little beautiful (Yeah) pewter-gray poodles, how cute are they? (The fuck?)
Well, looks like them pooches are screwed today (I'm)
Stuck in my ruthless ways (Yep), and I refusе to change (Yep)
Nothin' to lose or gain (Nopе), guess I just choose to stay

[Chorus]
Evil (Yeah), I'm so evil
Rotten to the core, a fuckin' twisted cerebral
I'm so evil, so evil
It's obvious that I am not like other people
'Cause I'm evil, I'm so evil
Rotten to the core, a fuckin' twisted cerebral
I'm so evil, so evil
It's obvious that I am not like other people (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
My medicine cabinet's big enough to fit a cab in it
Tablets, I split like half of this capsule, it's travelin' like a javelin
Through my abdomen, my stomach's unravelin'
Might end up havin' Slim say some shit you feel fucked up for laughin' at, yeah
And I'm phenomenal at it (What?), and that's problematic (What?)
But if y'all fanatics (Huh?), maybe I'm your habit (Yeah)
And I got all the dope (What?), so send me all them addicts (Get 'em all)
And watch me shoot 'em up (Pew-pew) like semi-automatics (Come on)
Slim snaps like a chin-strap
Had my share of lows, yeah, now I'm the exact (What?)
Opposite, just like a prostitute when she's gettin' smacked (Now)
Pimp slaps, only way I'm hittin' my bottom, bitch (Yeah, take 'em back)
I was five when they tried to say I stuck a live grenade
Up inside of a microwave, I behave like a child, ayy
Even when stakes are high as the price of an angus, I filet
By the way, I think I just gave Skylar Gray hepatitis A (Ew)
But when it's sink-or-swim, I just say, \"It's not me, it's him\" (Sorry)
There's a demon who's deep within
All I need is MD, or weed, or Henny, or Jim Beam, or Rémy, or Seagram's Gin
Just to get underneath your skin, I would like you to meet my twin

Holy shit, Cait' Jenner just flipped (Yo)
Told me knock this shit off and quit, and get off her dick (Damn)
And I've had a bad day, I just slapped Dre
Do not tell me what I can't say (Why?), that's gay (What's wrong with that?)
And not the good kind of gay either (What?)
Where two men fuck each other and hate beaver (Woah)
What the fuck? Wait, we've established I'm straight, see, the (No)
Way they try to make me the devil, the atheist (Oh)
Shit can get a lot worse, these are my first thoughts, Johnnie Walker, this my third shot (Yeah)
And I don't stop 'til the shots heard, pops for blocks, got the Mossberg cocked (What?)
Couple choppers, two Glocks, a 2Pac shirt, Dockers, and boxers dropped
Lookin' awkward as I walk into Oxford (Stop, the fuck?)
So much ammunition, I sweat lead
And just bought you a new bedspread for your deathbed (Haha)
And I just got it made like Special Ed said
Word to Redman, I'm a meth-head
Used to get fed pet meds by my redneck stepdad
'Til I beat his ass to death with a cassette deck (Ah)
So much bloodshed that when he bled from his head gash (Yeah)
It's kinda like I'm a bookworm (Huh?)
'Cause I ain't stoppin' 'til everything gets red
Call this sex ed with a splash of necrophilia (What?)
'Cause when I say that I'm really the evilest, I'm fuckin' deadass (I'm fuckin' deadass, haha)
Maybe what I need now more than likely's a psych eval'
Mama, how do you like me now? (Huh?)
Are you proud of me yet, Debbie? (Huh?) I done turned my whole life around
But I think I'm just like you now because I turned out so fuckin'

Meet Eddie, 23 years old
Fed up with life and the way things are going
(Damn, I'm going fucking insane)
He decides to rob a liquor store
(I gotta take this shit, I can't take it no more, holmes)
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
(Shit is mine)
And suddenly (I gotta do this)
His conscience comes into play (I gotta do this)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre, Eminem, & (Eddie)]
Alright, stop (Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (Who are you?)
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience
That's nonsense
Go in, gaffle the money, and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs
(Can I borrow this?)
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades
Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns
Fuck that, do that shit, shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (You're right)
Not over this shit (Stop)
Drop the biscuit (I will)
Don't even listen to Slim, yo, he's bad for you
You know what, Dre? I don't like your attitude

I don't know
Look, look, look
Damn
Look, it's gonna be alright, alright?
O-okay
Look, give me a kiss, pull your pants off, come on

[Interlude: Mark Avery]
Meet Stan, 21 years old
After meeting a young girl at a rave party
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom
Once again, his conscience comes into play

[Verse 2: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Now, listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
And smearin' her lipstick, slip this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair? (Uh-huh)
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot, bare
'Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie Kids?
No, but I seen the porno with Sun Doobiest
Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?
Man, fuck that, hit that shit raw dog, then bail
[Interlude: The Isley Brothers, Mark Avery, (Grady), & Grady's Wife]
Here I lay
(Man, it feels good to be home)
Meet Grady, a 29-year-old construction worker
After coming home from a hard day's work
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
To find his wife in bed with another man
(What the fuck?) Grady

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
Alright, calm down, relax, start breathin'
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'
While you at work, she's with some dude tryna get off
Fuck slittin' her throat, cut this bitch's head off
Wait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?
What, she tripped, fell, landed on his dick?
Tsh, alright, Shady, maybe he's right, Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Okay, thought about it? Still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
What you say?
What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?
I'ma kill you, motherfucker
Uh-uh, temper, temper
Mr. Dre, Mr. N.W.A, Mr. AK
Comin' straight outta Compton, y'all better make way
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that
Aw, fuck it, what am I sayin'?
Shoot 'em both, Grady, where's your gun at?"""@it ;

*Spitting*

[Verse]
With balls, in his durag, he sags, fearin' no man
He stands, pen in his hand like Edward Scissorhands
Who slices competition and just goes about his business
Anyone who knows about him knows about his shindig
Shenanigans, and all his wacky antics in the papers
Shady's danglin' a baby tangled in a blanket, stranglin'
And hangin' him over the railing by the ankles on some gangster shit
Child endangerment, dark brain, arcane with it, Mark Twainin' it
You aren't tamin' it, sharp pain in the heart
Aimin' a bar, chamber to carve names in it
Start sprayin' and start ravin' on beef, starved, cravin' it
You're at arm's length, you're in harm's way of it
'Bout to show your ass why I'm still a pain in it
You wanna know how I do it? I can't explain this shit
Mechanic's brain with a pinch of Big Daddy Kane in it
But I can show you the ropes 'til you get the hang of it
Elephantiasis of the nuts, element
Of Intelligent Hoodlum, Arrested Development
Cella Dwellas and Wise Intelligent, since elementary
Through Hell I went, accelerant from lack of melanin
Failin' in school, smart aleck wit
Helped me to rebel against shit so well and vent
So eloquently, yet, I was irrelevant
Soon as I quit givin' a fuck, I started to sell a bit
Now let's travel inside the mind of a hater
'Cause I don't see no fans, all I see's a bunch of complainers
\"Kendrick's album was cool, but it didn't have any bangers
Wayne's album or Ye's, couldn't tell you which one was lamer
Joyner's album was corny, Shady's new shit is way worse
Everything is either too tame or there's too much anger
I didn't like the beat, so I hated Might Delete Later\"
You nerdy pricks would find somethin' wrong with 36 Chambers
It's what they do to the greats
Pick apart a Picasso and make excuses to hate
So you can wait for your flowers until you're blue in the face
Stupid, you ain't gonna get 'em until your funeral wake (Hm)"""@it ;

Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window (Window)

And even if I could, it'd all be grey

Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There prob'ly was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her? I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you prob'ly hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan

It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold for you, for four hours, and you just said, \"no\"
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver? You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else, so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan, PS: We should be together too
[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window (Window)
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months, and still no word, I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' ninety on the freeway
Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, \"In the Air of the Night\"
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is: You coulda rescued me from drownin'
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you, and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim, shut up, bitch! I'm tryna talk
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see? I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh, shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?!
[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window (Window)
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother, I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but, Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car, they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was, it was you

Man, whatever

Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit

This song is for anyone
Fuck it, just shut up and listen

[Verse 1]
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zags and this bag of this weed
It gives me the shit needed to be the most meanest MC on this—
On this Earth, and since birth, I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension, dispensin' these sentences
Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently
Off of this chest, and I rest again peacefully
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
Do not come and speak to me
I don't know you, and, no, I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. *NSYNC, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me, my tank is on empty
No patience is in me, and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you ten feet in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me, just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom, and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you
I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, everyday I am
(Ha) Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, everyday I am
(Ha) I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, \"Oh, it's his lyrical content
The song Guilty Conscience has gotten such rotten responses\"
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin
Where were the parents at?
And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see
An upper-class city havin' this happenin'
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way, but I'm glad
'Cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire to burn
And it's burnin', and I have returned
[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, everyday I am
(Ha) I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 3]
I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired that I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top a My Name Is
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience
To deal with these cocky Caucasians who think
I'm some wigga who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep askin' the same fuckin' questions
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where, and the how
'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out (Argh)
'Cause they drivin' me crazy, I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand, and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without someone standin' by it
No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad
[Chorus]
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, everyday I am
(Ha) I don't know, that's just the way I am

I put wives at risk with a knife like this (Ah!) (Shit)

I'm in the backseat of your truck with duct tape stretched out
Ducked the fuck way down, waitin' to straight jump out
Put it over your mouth, and grab you by the face — what now?
Oh, you want me to watch my mouth? How?
Take my fuckin' eyeballs out and turn 'em around? (Look)
I'll burn your fuckin' house down, circle around

So who's bringin' the guns in this country? (Hm?)
I couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun through customs over in London
And last week I seen this Schwarzenegger movie
Where he's shootin' all sorts of these motherfuckers with a Uzi
I see these three little kids up in the front row
Screaming, \"Go!\" with their seventeen-year-old uncle
I'm like, guidance?! Ain't they got the same moms
And dads who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?
And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear?
What about the make-up you allow your twelve-year-old daughter to wear? (Hm?)
So tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words
When his bus driver's screamin' at him, fuckin' him up worse (Go sit the fuck down, you little fucking prick!)
And \"fuck\" was the first word I ever learned
Up in the third grade, flippin' the gym teacher the bird (Look!)
So read up 'bout how I used to get beat up
Peed on, be on free lunch and changed school every three months
My life's like kind of what my wife's like (What?)
Fucked up after I beat her fuckin' ass every night: Ike
So how much easier would life be if nineteen
Million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?

I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch

I never knew I, knew I'd have a new house or a new car
A couple years ago, I was more poorer than you are
I don't got that bad of a mouth, do I?
Fuck! Shit! Ass! Bitch! Cunt! Shooby-de-doo-wop! (Oops)
Skibbedy-be-bop, a Christopher Reeves
Sonny Bono, skis, horses and hittin' some trees (Hey)
How many retards'll listen to me
And run-up in the school shootin' when they're pissed at a tea-
-cher? Her? Him? Is it you? Is it them?
\"Wasn't me, Slim Shady said to do it again!\"
Damn, how much damage can you do with a pen?
Man, I'm just as fucked up as you woulda been
If you woulda been in my shoes, who woulda thought
Slim Shady would be somethin' that you woulda bought?
That woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop
I just said it, I ain't know if you'd do it or not

Yeah, this one's for the mama that I never knew (Never knew)
I took acid just to burn all of my memories of you
I guess now I really wanna know the truth
How'd you leave your only child at nine for another dude?
Took that pain and punched my father in the stomach 'til he bled
Hit the store and stole a forty and took that shit to the head
All the years that you ignored me, left me sleepless in the bed
I hope daddy got some kids because your only son is dead
My revenge, got it in the end (In the end)
I'm so hard to reach, you won't see me again (Me again)
I spent 20 years waiting on the stairs
Now I'm finished thinking anyone will ever hear these prayers

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
If I die before I wake, smoke me out at Heaven's gate
Bring me back to life on Sunday, pour me up the devil's drink
Wake up, go to work on Monday, grind it out for seven straight
You showed me that just because we're blood don't mean we relate

[Post-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly & phem with Lil Skies]
All my dark days came in the summer
All my thoughts changed, now I'm the loner
Everything stayed, you were the runner

Hold up, stack my money up just for a rainy day
Play with MGK and I will pull up where you stay (Yeah)
I die for my brother, I don't have nothin' to say (No)
I died when my baby mama told me I was fake (Damn)
I got real shooters, they ain't worried 'bout a case (Woah)
I got people talkin', but won't say shit to my face (Yeah)
EST for life, my opps all rolling in they grave (Damn)
See me doin' good, I put that work in like a slave (Work, we up)
Up all night, mind cloudy, don't be spooked
If I show you love, then will you always tell the truth? (Truth)
Feel like I'm goin' crazy, couldn't trust no one but you
Suicidal thoughts keep tellin' me jump off the roof
If I die tonight, know, I ain't got nothin' to prove
CSI gon' say we was the realest in the room
Fuck with mine, I kill 'cause I got everything to lose
Fuck with mama, you know what I'll do (Yeah)

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
If I die before I wake, smoke me out at Heaven's gate (Smoke me out)

Keep playing on repeat (Yeah)
I burn 'em all so I can start sleeping (Woah)
And all the bad, I'll make it good (Yeah)
I wouldn't change the past if I could (Woah)

Am I wrong for bein' lost?
The pressures of bein’ boss exhausted every bone in my body
I can't walk, I don't talk, I scream, I don’t stop to think
I'm so close to the dream that I can't go to sleep
Ironic, I know, so I need more chronic to roll
Tryna find what's more important, the money or my soul
It's cold, I'm low, I'm caught between the roads
Under the Hollywood sign, you get blinded by the glow, uh
Yo, how could you look me in the face?
You sat at the table with my daughter
Promisin' you got us right after you finished sayin’ grace
Why don’t you tell her what you're hiding in the bank?
It’s time to cut my lawn and see the snakes
It's time to tell the truth to every fan who doesn't understand
That it's because of you they had to wait
While you left me here to deal with all the hate
I still smile but feel so fake
It’s no sun, the clouds are opaque
So much shade I read on one page
I can't even look at your name without gettin' the shakes
What a mistake, uh, look how you take, uh
What doesn't belong to you, this was a rape
And if fate send us both to Heaven

I woke up sweatin', tryna forget I'm in a mansion
'Cause fans are mad at my expansion
And my friend I thought was family
Who'd always understand me
Got offended 'cause he jealous
We supposed to be at the GRAMMYs
I'm askin', when did pride and passion
Get mistaken for handouts and ass-kissin'?
The fact is I made it from trailer trash to Saks Fifth
Took it from underground to massive and the come up was classic
Back when white boys rapped, they gettin' they ass kicked
I was battlin', puttin' these rappers in caskets
I was walkin' home, gettin' jumped after classes
Tell me, why don't my haters mention that shit?
Now my rent is due and I'm a tenant gettin' by with no credit
Got residue from a sedative I ain't get from the medic
My schedule is so fuckin' hectic, but still I'm in debt
I'd be better off dead so life insurance keep my family fed
It's because of y'all I couldn't separate from my career
'Cause of y'all I hated myself for so many years
'Cause of you, you ain't never gonna see me trust
Even if I got a wife, she just somebody I fuck

I sold some tickets
To come see my downfall
It sold out in minutes
I saw friends in the front row
They'll leave when I'm finished
And the light in my name's gone
'Cause the ones who gas you up
Only come around when the flame's on and
(I gave you my life, oh, oh-oh)
Ayy, fuck it

[Pre-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly & Kevin Gruft]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I use a razor to take off the edge, \"Jump off the ledge,\" they said
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
\"Take the laser, aim at my head and paint the walls red,\" I said
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm crazy, I'm off the meds, I'm \"better off dead,\" they said
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I use a razor to take off the edge, jump off the ledge

[Chorus]
I'm sellin' tickets to my downfall
I'm sellin' tickets to my downfall
I'm sellin' tickets to my downfall
I'm sellin' tickets to my downfall

Get tickets for your favorite artists

[Verse 2]
Uh
My finger's burning from the temperatures (Temperatures)
My preacher led me off the precipice (Fuck)
If I'm a painter, I'd be a depressionist (Depressionist)
I need this time to decompress
From this ketamine, this cocaine
This medicine for my growing pain
This weed I've been smoking, I'm dying inside

[Pre-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly & Kevin Gruft]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I use a razor to take off the edge, \"Jump off the ledge,\" they said
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
\"Take the laser, aim at my head and paint the walls red,\" I said
(Fuck you)
I'm crazy, I'm off the meds, I'm \"better off dead,\" they said

I'm sellin' tickets to my downfall
I'm sellin' tickets to my downfall
